# This is my portfolio website

Hi! This is my portfolio website as a UX designer and Frontend developer. I publish this site even when it is just a MVP version in order to receive early comments if there any. Free free to contact me for any thing :)

The address is : [ppaann.github.io](https://ppaann.github.io/)

The website is under construction and updated on daily-bases.

## As UX designer

I share stories about my UX work, including how I conducted UX research and the entire process of redesigning the suomi24.fi website.

## As Frontend developer

I am developing this website using the React platform and hosting it on GitHub. Currently for this draft version, only CSS and inline styles are being used for the design and the layout is not yet responsive. However, I plan to improve everything and include more frontend technology showcases in the future.


# Site development plan

This portfolio is not only a show case for my UX design, but also a playground for me to have fun with the frontend development. I am in the mood of learning by doing, therefore I will explore different tools and try cool stuffs in the website. 


## Style

When styling, I will not use any ready made UI platforms. Instead, I will learn the pattern from the style guide such as MUI and Apple to make my own styles. 

Step by step, my goal is to create a mini version of UI library, which is independent from the frontend code.

Tools | Comments
----- | -----
Emotion | home.js
SCSS | else

### ToDos

There are long list of things I want to play with style. 

1. responsive layout
2. Theme
3. Storybook
4. SCSS Mixins
5. Testing: Chromatic's [visual testing service](https://www.chromatic.com/features/test?ref=storybookblog.ghost.io)
