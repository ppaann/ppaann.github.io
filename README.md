# This is my portfolio website

Hi! This is my portfolio website as a UX designer and Frontend developer.

The website is under construction. 

## As UX designer

I share stories about my UX work, including how I conducted UX research and the entire process of redesigning the suomi24.fi website.

## As Frontend developer

I am developing this website using the React platform and hosting it on GitHub. Currently, only CSS and inline styles are being used for the design. However, I plan to showcase more frontend technologies in the future
