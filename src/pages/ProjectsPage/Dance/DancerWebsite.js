              Vivian showcased her dance and work exclusively on Instagram. I
              suggested creating a website to enhance her professional image,
              inspire others, and reach audiences beyond Instagram. After
              convincing her of its benefits, I designed and developed the site.

            Vivian has started a new career path as a pole dance trainer, and
            she is eager to showcase her journey and professional capabilities.
            Her transition from a Biochemistry Post-Doc to a pole dance
            enthusiast in her 40s is not just a career change but a personal
            transformation. Vivian's story is one of discovering a newfound
            passion and mastering it to the point where she can now impart her
            knowledge and joy to others. As a beginning coach, while she may not
            have an extensive portfolio, her aim is to use her own story and
            expertise to inspire and encourage more people to explore the world
            of pole dance and consider her courses.

            Instagram has it's limitations, it can only showcase a limited part
            of her story. And it requires registration to view the content.
            Vivian requires a website to reach a broader audience, especially
            those beyond the realm of social media. The website's primary goal
            is to narrate her unique story, showcase her skills, and facilitate
            easy contact for potential clients.

            Understanding potential clients' hesitations is key to encouraging
            participation in pole dance. In collaboration with Vivian, we've
            identified specific concerns to address based on her experience. To
            counter these, the website will feature empathetic slogans and
            content that resonate with the target audience, particularly
            addressing common hesitations related to age, physical fitness, and
            body image.
