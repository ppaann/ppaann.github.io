          Overview
        </Heading>

        <p>
          The Suomi24 team aimed to redesign their website to make it more
          fresh-looking and appealing to younger audiences, while also improve
          its mobile compatibility. In addition to updating the user interface
          (UI), the team needed to replace the outdated FlightJS frontend
          platform with React. I joined the team in August 2018 as the sole UX
          designer, leading the UX research and design for the new UI.
          Additionally, I worked as a frontend engineer with two other engineers
          to maintain and enhance the website.

          <p>
            The number of active users is declining. Suomi24 is not appearing on
            the first page of Google search results. Advertisement revenue is
            not showing a profitable trend. The frontend platform being used is
            no longer being updated.

        <p>
          Our first research focused on real website users. We recruited
          volunteers from the Suomi24 forum, selecting a diverse range of
          participants based on age, gender, location, history with Suomi24, and
          frequency of visits. These participants were invited to participate in
          a<b> one-on-one user interview</b> and a <b>first-impression test</b>,
          which helped us gain an in-depth understanding of their feelings about
          Suomi24. In addition to the interviews, we collected over 500 user
          responses through an <b>online survey</b> on the forum.{" "}

              The website's anonymous nature discourages users from registering,

              Users are more interested in local events and building their own

          Users' Motivations and Pain Points

        <p>
          At first glance, it seems that users find the website useful but not
          interesting. However, upon closer inspection, we found that users have
          divergent motivations. Creating personas has helped us clarify these
          divergences, and we can use them as a basis for use cases in later
          development stages.
        </p>
        <p>
          After discussing with the Product Owner and the Business Development
          team, we have decided to focus on two personas because they
          represented two user groups: the information seeker and the explorer.
          The information seeker is someone who visits the website with a
          specific purpose, seeking knowledge or social approval. On the other
          hand, the explorer visits the website to relax and doesn't have a
          specific purpose in mind.

        <p>
          To gain insight into user behavior, we analyzed data collected from
          Google Analytics, VWO, and Hotjar. Our analysis focused on where users
          clicked the most, what was visible in the first three seconds after
          the page loaded, whether users scrolled to access the information we
          provided, and whether users found the information relevant and useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on our findings, we concluded that it is essential to rearrange
          the layout to make the most of the first screen. This will enable
          users to quickly access the information they need and make the website
          more user-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          To evaluate the ROI of our redesign, it's crucial to analyze the
          analytics data. By doing so, we can set up clear targets and adjust
          our design strategy accordingly.

        <p>
          Redesigning a website with a long history, such as Suomi24, requires a
          collaborative effort. The project is dependent on other products, with
          numerous links, components, and shared APIs. In addition, the
          marketing and advertisement management team reserves every
          advertisement on the screen, making it difficult to rearrange them. To
          clarify responsibilities and the impact of each stakeholder on the
          redesign work, we collaborated with the product managers, developers,
          marketing team, and content managers to create a stakeholder map.{" "}

        <p>
          One of the severe problems found during usability testing and user
          interviews is that there are too many advertisements, particularly in
          the thread pages, which is the landing page for more than 97% of
          users. The irrelevant advertisement image, sometimes resulting in an
          empty white space when the ad doesn't load successfully. This often
          disrupts users, and they may leave the page or find it unappealing.
          However, removing or moving the ad lower down the page is not an
          option as it is one of our main sources of income and must be visible
          at the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          I have redesigned the page in a way that the advertisement is visible
          in the first place, along with the topic and a portion of the content.
          The final result was monitored using Google Ad Manager, and both the
          impression and the reading depth on the page slightly increased.
        </p>
        <p>
          I presented two proposals to let market team choose:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Move the ad beneath the topic and the content of the main thread.
              When text is too long, clip the text
              &lt;text-overflow=‘ellipsis’&gt; to ensure the ad shows more than
              50%.
            </li>
            <li>Introduce a smaller ad slot for mobile view.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The final result was monitored using Google Ad Manager, and both the
            impression and the reading depth on the page slightly increased.

          Research indicates that over 74% of Suomi24 page views are from mobile
          devices, and this number is on the rise. Therefore, we are focusing
          our efforts on refining the mobile UI.

              Improve search-ability by making the search feature available in
              the top navigation widget.
            </li>
            <li>Reduce dividers and layer margins in the thread view.</li>
            <li>Minimize the use of different colors and font sizes.</li>
            <li>Increase the interaction area by using meaningful icons.</li>
            <li>Improve the mobile usability of the navigation widget.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            We conducted several rounds of testing to ensure smooth and
            intuitive interactions, as well as a relaxed and effortless UI for
            mobile users.

          Don’t ditch the old design too soon
        </Heading>
        <p>
          <p>
            We discovered that fewer than 10% of users visit the homepage of
            suomi24.fi, with most of them navigating to other websites. We
            wanted to make the homepage more useful so that users could find
            interesting content and continue their journey inside the forum.
            With good intentions, we made a significant change to the homepage
            to provide more helpful information and allow users to use the
            homepage more effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, our abrupt change replaced the entire old homepage with the
            new design, resulting in complaints from users. We soon realized
            that many users used the old homepage as an index, from which they
            accessed news, mail, and even Google. We acknowledge that this usage
            of the homepage is valuable, and there is nothing inherently wrong
            with how users interacted with it. As a result, we reverted back to
            the original homepage design very quick, and redesign the links.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important to always keep the user's needs and habits in mind
            when making changes to a website or application. In this case, it
            seems like the users had developed a certain behavior and pattern of
            use for the homepage that was disrupted by the sudden change. It
            might be worth considering conducting more user research to identify
            what specific improvements could be made to the homepage to make it
            more useful without disrupting the user's established patterns of
            use.
